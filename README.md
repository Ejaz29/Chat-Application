# Chat-Application
Chat Application using socket programming and java swings for GUI. It is a server and multiple clients chat application.
To download and use the project it is better to use Intellij editor.
Firstly run the server program, Now your pc acts like a server and now you can connect as many clients(Friends) as you want.
If your friends from other network wants to connect, then share your IP address with them and ask them to go to client program 128th line and change from localhost to your IP address. Now if they run the client program they will be directly connected to  your server.
Note: If you run or start the server then your friend need not start the server.
Many updates are yet to come..... Happy chatting :)
